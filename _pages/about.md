Hello! Thanks for stopping by.

My name is Ari Khoudary and I use they/them/theirs pronouns. I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Cognitive Sciences](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/index.php) at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), where I am also affiliated with the [Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory (CNLM)](https://cnlm.uci.edu/) and the [Center for Theoretical and Behavioral Sciences (CTBS)](https://www.ctbs.socsci.uci.edu/index.php). I am co-advised by [Aaron Bornstein](https://aaron.bornstein.org) and [Megan Peters](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/cnclab/), and my research is supported by a [Howard Schneiderman-NIMH T32 fellowship](https://cnlm.uci.edu/t32/) through the CNLM.

My research aims to understand how humans use past experiences to reduce uncertainty about the present. Currently, I'm thinking about how implicit metacognition facilitates dynamic integration of memory and visual evidence during perceptual decision making, and use a combination of computational modeling, human behavior, and neuroimaging to try to get some answers to this question.

Before starting grad school, I got a B.S. in Psychology (honors) with a second major in Philosophy from [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu){:target="_blank"} in 2019. I wrote a double-credit senior thesis (advised in Psychology by [Maureen Ritchey](http://thememolab.org){:target="_blank"} and in Philosophy by [Richard Atkins](http://rkatkins.com/){:target="_blank"}) on the epistemic reliability of episodic memory, using an original experiment on source monitoring as a case study. Then, I worked as a lab manager and research assistant in [Felipe De Brigard's](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/people/felipe-de-brigard){:target="_blank"} [Imagination and Modal Cognition Lab](https://imclab.org){:target="_blank"} at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu){:target="_blank"}, where I did some neuroimaging and experimental philosophy research in addition to helping Felipe and [Walter Sinnott-Armstrong](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/people/walter-sinnott-armstrong){:target="_blank"} coordinate the [Summer Seminars in Neuroscience and Philosophy (SSNAP)](https://ssnap.net){:target="_blank"}.

On a personal note, I am a queer, trans, neurodivergent, Syrian-American who cares deeply about the emotional and interpersonal dimensions of scientific research. I share my thoughts in this domain on my [blog](https://ari-khoudary.github.io/blog){:target="_blank"}. I have long-standing interests in music, philosophy, food, and interdisciplinary endeavors. I also have a [cat](assets/img/stinky.jpg){:target="_blank"} who I love very much. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, appreciating nature, and daydreaming about (nearby) possible worlds.
