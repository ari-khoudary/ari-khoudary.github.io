And like that, year 2 of the PhD is in the books! I'm not sure what I did to deserve all this, but I have a laundry list of wins to share: I was awarded the Jared M. Roberts Memorial Award through the CNLM, I won the Cognitive Sciences department bake-off, I was selected as a DECADE Outstanding Student Representative, and I was chosen for the Schneiderman-NIMH T32 Fellowship through the CNLM! I feel so incredibly grateful for all of this recognition and looking forward to a nice summer of conferencing and writing my Masters exam :)
